- Strong believer in IaC, GitOps, automating toil and other techniques to make releases common, routine, and boring.
- Designer of processes where secure-thinking is baked-in.  Prevent afterthought security solely for checks-the-box compliance.
- Believer in targeting correct SLOs w/ Blameless culture.  All things measurable should be and processes adapted accordingly.  Overachieving an SLO; be more aggressive - Underachieving; more conservative.
